This morning I was reflecting on how much has changed in the last 90 days for us as Apple devs. The release of Swift, new UI for OS X, new APIs for both iOS and OS X, and not to mention the release of the Apple Watch today. The breakneck pace of the change and innovation is almost overwhelming. This reflection reminded me of my time at WWDC and learning Swift by writing [SwiftHTTP](https://github.com/daltoniam/SwiftHTTP). The library has certainly change a lot since that first version but still has the same goal, learn Swift and simplify HTTP requests.
