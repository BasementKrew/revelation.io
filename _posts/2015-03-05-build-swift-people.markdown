The last few weeks, I have been asked the same question, "how do I load asynchronous images or data in a UITableView in Swift?". While I love to help out, answering the same question can get a bit repetitive. I then used my powers of deduction and said "wait, I have a blog! I should write an article on this.". A few hours later Swift People was born.

We will create the "Swift People" project, which will walk through the basics of creating a new project with framework management and load remote data and images into a tableView. Let's start with the framework management to get [Skeets](https://github.com/daltoniam/Skeets), [SwiftHTTP](https://github.com/daltoniam/SwiftHTTP), and [JSONJoy](https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy-Swift) in our project. The full project is available [here](https://github.com/Vluxe/SwiftPeople).

## Framework Management

There are several great options for framework management, namely: [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), [Rogue](https://github.com/acmacalister/Rogue) and [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). I would recommend checking out each to see which one best fits in your workflow. Swift People will use CocoaPods since it is the most well known.

If you haven't install CocoaPods yet, check out the install docs [here](http://cocoapods.org).

Next create a Xcode project (I named mine SwiftPeople). Then from terminal navigate to your new project directory and run:

 ```
 touch Podfile
 ```

 Now open the `Podfile` file with your favorite text editor and add these lines:

 ```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'SwiftHTTP'
pod 'Skeets'
pod 'JSONJoy-Swift'
 ```

 Next run this in terminal:

```
pod install
```

This will install the pods. Close your Xcode project and open the newly created workspace file. This can be done from terminal if you want.

```
open SwiftPeople.xcworkspace
```

## API

Now that we have a workspace, Next we need to get some mock data to build our app with. I came across [Random User](https://randomuser.me). This handy API provides all the mock user data we need to build a feed of people. Let's make a SwiftHTTP request and build a JSONJoy model of that data.

```swift
static func getUsers(finished:((Array<User>) -> Void)) {
    let task = HTTPTask()
    task.responseSerializer = JSONResponseSerializer()
    task.GET("http://api.randomuser.me", parameters: ["results": "30"], success: { (response: HTTPResponse) in
        if let data = response.responseObject as? NSData {
            var collect = Array<User>()
            //get a decoder of the data
            let decoder = JSONDecoder(data)
            //check the array is valid and loop through the array
            if let arr = decoder["results"].array {
                for subDecoder in arr {
                    //flatten the json
                    let user = subDecoder["user"]
                    if user.error == nil {
                        collect.append(User(user))
                    }
                }
            }
            //move to the main thread as we are done with our processing
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
              finished(collect)
            })
        }
        }, failure: { (error: NSError, response: HTTPResponse?) -> Void in
        println("failed to get random users: \(error)")
    })
}
```

This method is static, so we can call it without having to create a new `User` object. I placed this my `viewDidLoad` of my view controller for this example, which we will see in the next section. Now let's take a look at the JSON handling in the `User` object.

```swift
struct User: JSONJoy {
    let name: Name
    let picture: Picture
    //computed property to return a full name: "John Doe".
    var displayName: String { return "\(name.first) \(name.last)" }

    //implement the JSONJoy protocol
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
        name = Name(decoder["name"])
        picture = Picture(decoder["picture"])
    }
}

//represents the User's name
struct Name: JSONJoy {
    let first: String
    let last: String

    //JSONJoy init method
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
        first = safeString(decoder,"first")
        last = safeString(decoder,"last")
    }

    //fetch the random users from the network
    static func getUsers(finished:((Array<User>) -> Void)) {
      SwiftHTTP request and such from above....
    }
}

//represents the User's picture
struct Picture: JSONJoy {
    let thumbnail: String
    let small: String
    let medium: String
    let large: String

    //JSONJoy init method
    init(_ decoder: JSONDecoder) {
        thumbnail = safeString(decoder,"thumbnail")
        small = safeString(decoder,"small")
        medium = safeString(decoder,"medium")
        large = safeString(decoder,"large")
    }
}

//unwrap and read a string safely
func safeString(decoder: JSONDecoder, key: String) -> String {
    if let str = decoder[key].string {
        return str
    }
    return ""
}
```

That takes care of the JSON processing and should be fairly straight forward.

## TableView

Now that we have an API that can retrieve data and transform it into models, let's hook it up the the UITableView. There is a storyboard in the sample project if you want to see where the tableView comes from. Let's fetch the users and load them into our tableView.

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    //our static method from the User model
    User.getUsers{ (users: Array<User>) in
        self.users = users //hold onto the user models
        self.tableView.reloadData()
    }
}
```

Now let's implement the tableView datasource.

```swift
//number of rows
func tableView(tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    if let users = self.users {
        return users.count
    }
    return 0
}

//style the cells
func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    var cell: UserTableViewCell! = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier("user") as? UserTableViewCell
    if cell == nil {
        cell = UserTableViewCell(style: .Default, reuseIdentifier: "user")
    }
    //we have a cell, now let's style it.
    if let users = self.users {
        if indexPath.row < users.count {
            let user = users[indexPath.row]
            //we have our user model, let's update the cell with the data
            cell.imgView.image = nil
            cell.txtLabel.text = user.displayName
            //if the cell is being recycled, make sure to cancel the old url it was loading.
            if cell.currentImgUrl != "" {
                ImageManager.cancel(cell.currentImgUrl)
            }
            //fetch the remote image using skeets
            ImageManager.fetch(user.picture.medium, progress: { (progress: Double) in
                }, success: { (data: NSData) in
                    //got the image, load it into the UI
                    cell.imgView.image = UIImage(data: data)
                    cell.currentImgUrl = ""
                }, failure: { (error: NSError) in
                    println("failed to get image: \(error)")
            })
            cell.currentImgUrl = user.picture.medium
        }
    }
    return cell
}
```

## Fin

That's it! Here is what our what our final product will look like.

This is a simple example, but gives a good start point to start building apps that interacts with asynchronous data. As always, questions, comments, general thoughts, and random rants are appreciated. [@daltoniam](https://twitter.com/daltoniam)
