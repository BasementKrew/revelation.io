Searching. Agurably one of the most important jobs of an API. I don't just mean hum drum, sort of kinda, I threw a SQL query together searching. I mean powerful, relevent, maybe even beautiful searching. A search that returns the searcher that very thing they were looking for. Today, I would like to describe my journey and first plunge into the world of full text searching, with what I would say is decently complex data set using Elastic Search.
