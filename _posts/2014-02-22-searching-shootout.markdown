Searching. Agurably one of the most important jobs of API can do is searching. I don't just mean hum drum sort of kinda I threw a SQL query together searching. I mean powerful relevent, maybe even beatiful searching. Some that returns the searcher that very thing they were looking for. Today I would look to describe my journey and first plunge into the world of full text searching with what I would say is decently complex data set using Elastic Search.
