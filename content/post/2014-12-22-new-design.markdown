We redesigned! You probably already noticed that though. We felt it was time for a new look that focused on readability and a modern design. We found a great theme by [@dirkfabisch](https://twitter.com/dirkfabisch). You can find the theme on his github [here](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/madiator). Dirk, if you ever read this, we thank you for sharing your work to make this great theme possible. 

We are taking the next week off for Christmas. [Austin](http://austincherry.me) will be kicking off next week (and next year!) with a Go article about routers. We are excited to see what 2015 brings and thanks for reading! Merry Christmas!
